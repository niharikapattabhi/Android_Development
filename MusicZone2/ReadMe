Hello and welcome to MusicZone!
Thank you for taking interest in our project. Let me walk you through it.

This project was created as a part of a miniproject requirement in the 7th semester of our engineering course.
It was a group project and the members are myself(Niharika Pattabhi), Medha Kumble, Yashodeep Pawar and Shreyas Tulpule.

Now let's check out what the project actually does:
-> Firstly you need to know that this is an entry level music player app.
   Hence why you will see some basic GUI with the default color scheme.
   
-> When u first start the app, you will see a screen that will ask you either to login or signup.
   We have used SQLite as our database for this project. 
   * signup requires you to provide an email address, set a password and retype the password for confirmation.
   * login will require you to enter in your registered email address and the password you created.
   
-> The application will access the external storage of the device it is installed on
   and look for .mp3 or .wav files, audio files, and display them in list form.
   
-> Once logged in you will see 3 options: play music, user profile and about us
   * play music as the name suggests lets you play music and toggle some features like:
     play, pause, skip forward or backward by 10 seconds, skip to next or previous song,
     loop current song and shuffle the list.
   * user profile let's the user chage profile picture by either selecting from gallery
     or by taking a picture through the camera.
   * about us section is somewhat similar to this readme file. It gives information about
     us, the creators of the app, and also lets you check out the location of our college.
     
  We hope this helps you in some way :)
